    "content": "Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as \"Straw Hat Luffy\" or simply \"Straw Hat\", is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew and closest friends). He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.\n\nBorn on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. \"Fire Fist\" Ace and Sabo. However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate \"Red-Haired\" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.\n\nAs a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has triumphed over a majority of these, successfully invading and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines.\n\nLuffy has gained wide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general recklessness, drawing many large bounties as well as the focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular. Currently, he is recognized as a central member of the Worst Generation,  the unwilling leader of the seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty of 3,000,000,000. Upon the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi after centuries, Luffy is also heralded by a few as the second coming of Joy Boy.\n\nHe is the main protagonist of the One Piece manga and anime series.\n\nAppearance\n\nLuffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his epithet \"Straw Hat Luffy\"), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, \"Red-Haired\" Shanks, who in turn received it from Gol D. Roger. Before the timeskip, his main outfit consisted of a red vest, light blue denim shorts cuffed just above his knees, and tan sandals. Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate. He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.\n\nBefore the Timeskip\nSimilar to most of his male crewmates, Luffy has the same outfit throughout most of the series. Luffy will often wear a different outfit to suit the climate of an island (such as a hooded parka on Drum Island or desert robes in Arabasta) but will switch back to his trademark red vest and blue shorts after the adventures on that island are over. Despite this, he will wear his usual outfit in different colors and has been known to sport other miscellaneous items on his person from time to time like in Thriller Bark and Sabaody Archipelago. According to Eiichiro Oda in 37 Volume SBS, Luffy does not know how to dress stylishly so sometimes he is advised on how to dress by more fashionable team members, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, and Robin.\nDuring the Drum Island Arc, he wore two different parkas, the first being a burgundy parka with white fur on the cuffs, hood, and hem, and then a checkered, hooded parka with the colors white, orange, and bright yellow, which Nami wore in the beginning.\nDuring the Arabasta Arc, he wore desert robes consisting of a dark red robe with three white rings decorated along both sleeves and a light blue wrap over his head.\nDuring the Skypiea Arc, he wore his vest open and additionally wore a black wristband around his left wrist with a white bangle over it. In 37 Volume SBS, Oda said that two members of his crew lent him accessories: a black wristband by Usopp and a white bracelet by Sanji.\nDuring the Long Ring Long Land Arc, Luffy wore an afro on his head, dark red shorts, and red bandages on his feet, getting an image of a blue flaming skull and crossbones painted on his chest as well, when he was fighting Foxy.\nDuring the Enies Lobby Arc, he wore black shorts with larger pockets than his blue shorts.\nDuring the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Luffy wore a white T-shirt with the Galley-La Company emblem on it in red; red liners around the top, shoulders, and collar; and navy-blue shorts.\nDuring the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore an orange vest and dark red shorts. After the battle against Moria in Thriller Bark, Luffy wore a dark decorated, jeweled armband around his left bicep, given to him by Nami. This armband was later revealed to be a map that leads to Captain John's lost treasure, which Buggy sought for some time; Luffy handed the armband over to Buggy in exchange for his services in navigating through Impel Down.\nDuring the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, in the manga, he wore a blue vest and red shorts (which can also be seen on the cover of Volume 52). In the anime, he wore the same blue vest, but dark blue shorts.\nDuring the Amazon Lily Arc, Luffy wore a light blue vest with maroon shorts.\nDuring the Impel Down Arc, Luffy wore his outfit from his stay on Amazon Lily until after his fight with Magellan, at which point he replaced his light blue vest with a bright yellow vest and brighter red shorts given to him by Inazuma.\n\nNo matter where he is, Luffy wears his Straw Hat through absolutely everything, though at the start, the hat was prone to get knocked off his head easily, forcing Luffy to either put it aside or have someone hold onto it during fights. From the Arabasta Arc onward, he has gotten a string strap for it, which was sewn on by Nami, allowing the hat to hang on his back from his neck during fights.\n\nDuring his return to Marineford to give a silent prayer, Luffy was briefly shown with four characters written on his right arm spelling 3D2Y, with the 3D crossed out to symbolize that the Straw Hat Pirates should meet up in 2 years (2Y) rather than the 3 days (3D) as planned after fleeing from Bartholomew Kuma.\n\nDuring his journey, Luffy has used the power of his Devil Fruit in creative ways, many of which involve altering his body. The greatest example of his altered appearance is the creation of his Gear techniques which dramatically affect his entire body:\nIn Gear 2, Luffy pumps more blood throughout his whole body, causing his sweat to rapidly vaporize and making it appear that he is releasing steam. In the anime, his entire skin turns slightly pink and shiny from the increased blood flow.\nIn Gear 3 form, Luffy blows a massive amount of air into his body, causing it to inflate and enlarge a specific part of his body to a size equivalent to that of a Giant. After the transformation wears off, his body temporarily shrinks to a child-sized form, with large hands and a vertically compressed head. The properties and appearance of this technique changed after the two-year timeskip.\n\nAfter the Timeskip\nAfter those two years, a few things have changed. He has grown slightly taller and is shown to be significantly more muscular due to his training. This can be seen in his slightly thicker neck, more pronounced deltoids, and a better-defined chest, which shows the X-shaped scar he received by then-Admiral Akainu covering most of it. His usual attire is mostly the same as it was two years ago, but instead of a vest, Luffy wears an open, 3/4-sleeved red cardigan with four buttons and with a yellow sash tied around his waist with the end hanging from his left hip (somewhat reminiscent of Gol D. Roger's outfit).\n\nDue to Luffy's increasing notoriety in addition to the increasing strength of his foes, after the timeskip he finds himself more often dressed in disguises to mask his identity, with varying levels of sophistication. Despite this, he still never loses his trademark straw hat and instead opts to at times cover it with other headwear.\n\nDuring the Punk Hazard Arc, Luffy wore a long winter coat with red and white horizontal stripes, along with yellow earmuffs and dark red gloves, which he stole from one of Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit. Just before leaving, he switched to a different coat that is all red with dark brown fur lining and a light brown belt, as well as brown gloves.\nDuring the Dressrosa Arc, due to his need to hide his identity in Doflamingo's territory, Luffy wore an open, dark blue short-sleeved shirt with a sunflower pattern, his standard blue shorts and yellow sash, and a black bowler hat over his straw hat. He also wore a fake beard. Upon entering the tournament for the Mera Mera no Mi in the Corrida Colosseum, he wore Viking-style armor, complete with a sword and shield. Upon revision to meet the tournament's weight restriction, he got rid of most of the armor, but kept the cape and helmet, along with his registration number '0556' and the word \"Lucy\" written on the back of his shirt, obscured by his cape. When he recovered after his battle against Doflamingo, Luffy wore a dark red tank top along with his standard shorts in brown (dark grey in the anime).\nAs he and the newly formed 'Sanji Retrieval Team' departed from Zou,  he swapped out his standard blue shorts for a brown pair.\nDuring the Whole Cake Island Arc, Luffy wore an open, fancy white shirt with puffy sleeves, red trim, and an ornate gold pattern on the collar along with red shorts and his standard yellow sash. He also had a decorative scarf wrapped around his straw hat after landing at the Seducing Woods, though he appears to have lost it during his battle with Charlotte Cracker. These clothes were eventually torn to shreds after several battles and he later dons a new outfit to meet with Capone Bege; a brick red blazer with matching shorts, a black dress shirt, and a pink cravat. He also fitted a black fedora to the top of his straw hat.\nDuring his fight with Sanji, Luffy loses one of his top teeth after being struck by a Diable Jambe Joue Shot directly into his face. However, it grew back after he drank a bottle of milk.\nDuring the Wano Country Arc, Luffy wore a red yukata with patchwork mon of a blue rounded sun on a cyan background and a yellow obi. He also had a topknot on top of his hair. He also had the Nidai Kitetsu he borrowed from Tenguyama Hitetsu. Before beginning the assault on Onigashima, Luffy received a set of samurai armor from Hitetsu. When helping Kin'emon and the others against Kaidou's fleet at sea, Luffy wore a long black coat, his usual red shirt, orange shorts and a purple sash. He also briefly wore a Beasts Pirates disguise created by Kin'emon when infiltrating Onigashima, which consisted of fake red horns, black pauldrons with white lining, a black belt with white lining and the Beast Pirates jolly roger on the front, which is connected to the pauldrons by brown straps connecting to a silver ring, black leather pants, a red feather cape, orange gloves, and his regular sandals. During his celebration of the Raid's success, Luffy wears another red yukata, this one with a blue sash and yellow-and-white hexagonal patterns. In the following days, he wears a third red yukata with a purple ocean wave pattern and an orange sash. As he leaves Wano, he is seen wearing his Raid outfit, though his orange shorts were swapped for yellow ones.\nDuring the Egghead Arc, Luffy received a long red coat with orange-yellow accents and the SSG logo, along with gloves, an earpiece, and a pair of red DOM Shoes. During his fight with Kizaru, he discarded this attire, remaining in his original shorts and sandals.\n\nAfter the two-year timeskip, Luffy developed another two Gears, with one of them having its own sub-transformations, as well as significantly changing Gear 3:\nDuring Luffy's two years of training, he further developed Gear 3 to have the air concentrated into his fist and a large sphere of air in his wrist, as opposed to throughout a whole limb as before. He also uses it in a variety of sizes, does not shrink afterward, and is almost always hardened with Armament Haki, giving it a shiny black appearance.\nIn Gear 4, Luffy's body proportions shift dramatically, specific to the exact form he is taking. In all forms, he gains dark rings around his eyes, and a level of Armament Haki coating over at least his arms and legs that has crimson accents in addition to the typical black.\nIn the Boundman form, Luffy inflates himself, transforming his torso to be more spherical. He increases the size of his arms to match his torso and spreads Armament Haki coating over portions of his upper chest, creating the same type of swirls as those on the Gomu Gomu no Mi. In the process of inflating, Luffy also becomes taller and more muscular.\nThe details of the Tankman form's regular appearance are unknown, as Luffy has only used a variation called the \"Manpuku Version\". In the Manpuku Version of Tankman, Luffy's body goes through a similar yet exaggerated transformation to Boundman. In this form, his torso inflates significantly more than the rest of his body, while his arms only slightly inflate. The Armament Haki coating covers most of his body except for his chest, creating a flame-like pattern. He goes through a much more significant height increase, though he loses the muscular physique of Boundman to increase the roundness of his body.\nIn the Snakeman form, Luffy's body does not shift dramatically, remaining largely the same in terms of overall proportions. While some expansion still occurs, it's much less than in Boundman and Tankman, with the bulk of the transformation occurring in Luffy's newly flame-like hair. Compared to the other forms, he has less Armament Haki spread, barely reaching his shoulders. He also gains a trail of steam and fire that drapes over his shoulders.\nIn Gear 5, Luffy's hair and clothes turn pure white (save for his sash and sandals). His hair takes on the appearance of a flame, and his eyes glow with large pink pupils. Like in Snakeman, he has a trail of gas draped over his shoulders, this time formed out of clouds.\n\nNon-Canon\n\nSimilarly to the main series, Luffy wears his standard outfit in most non-canon material. Starting with Movie 11, his standard wear is completely absent with very few exceptions.\n\n During Movie 3, he wears a red shirt with the number \"01\" in black in the middle. A deer costume with a fur coat and two tree branches for antlers was also momentarily seen.\n During the G-8 Arc, he infiltrates the kitchens as a Marine cook, wearing a white cook uniform, a blue scarf on his neck, and a white cook hat covering his straw hat.\n During Movie 6, Luffy wears a bright orange hoodie with the sleeves torn off, a black wristband on his left arm, and light blue shorts.\n During the Ice Hunter Arc, Luffy wears a pale-yellow parka with burgundy seams, and black triangular patches on the arms.\n During Movie 9, Luffy wears a red parka.\n During the Spa Island Arc, Luffy dresses in a pair of dark red swim trunks with the word 'Mermaid' written on the right leg, and a pair of cyan swimming goggles. He also carries two inner tubes: a white one with dark blue stripes, and an orange one with the Criminal logo on the side.\n During the Little East Blue Arc, he wears red-orange jacket exposed at the chest, and a pair of sky blue shorts.\n During Movie 10, prior to his meeting with Shiki, Luffy wears bright blue swim trunks with a blue-and-white cloud pattern, along with a yellow towel. When he was sent to Mereveille along with the rest of his crewmates, he wears a dark blue loose-fitting collared shirt with two light blue 'X' marks on each side, and loose pair of pale red shorts with bushy dark red rims. Slung on his shoulders are a yellow travel bag and a giant green canteen, and below his straw hat are two helmets: one yellow, and an orange one with undone straps and a pair of goggles. During his raid on Shiki's palace, he dresses in a black suit with a red dress shirt and a black tie, topped with a large coat sporting gold trim and white cuffs.\nDuring Movie 11, Luffy wears a short-sleeved orange hoodie with a gold patch saying '56 Gomu' on the left breast and both of his sleeves.\nDuring 3D2Y, Luffy wears a bright red hoodie with a furred hood, a gold zipper, and torn sleeves, with the back of the hood sporting a pawprint design, along with white wraps around his stomach and right bicep and his regular blue shorts. Since this takes place during the two-year timeskip, his hat is noticeably absent.\nDuring Episode of Luffy, Luffy wears a red hooded jumpsuit.\nDuring Adventure of Nebulandia, he wears a red short-sleeved zip-up hoodie with a stylized version of his Jolly Roger splayed across the front along with his typical blue shorts and yellow sash.\nDuring the Z's Ambition Arc, Luffy wears red shorts with 'Criminal' written on the left leg, and a black T-shirt showing a picture of a shark riding a wave.\nDuring Movie 12, Luffy celebrates the 'Cherry Blossom Party' wearing gray shorts and a gold V-neck shirt with a skeleton's sockets and teeth stitched on the front. Under his hat is a frilly orange cap with the buckles undone. When searching for Z on Secon Island, Luffy wears a leather jacket, a blue shirt with a faded cloud-like pattern, brown shorts, and dark brown boots. Out of the gear Mobston gave the Straw Hat Pirates to prepare for their fight with the Neo Marines, he chose a bright red long coat with gold trim over a red button up shirt, a yellow vest, a dark crimson sash, and black shorts. Strapped to the coat were two rapiers and a giant piece of meat on a bone.\nThe second outfit was designed in collaboration with Armani.\nAt the end of Opening 16 Hands Up!, Luffy is seen wearing a fancy black coat with gold accents, a burgundy dress shirt, a black tie, black shorts, and a yellow sash.\nIn Opening 17 Wake up!, Luffy wore a longer version of his typical red shirt with thin yellow and blood red edges over a white button-up shirt with a popped collar, an orange sash with no loose ends, blood red shorts, a yellow ball chain necklace with blood red gems hanging from the yellow ones, and a blood red, orange, and yellow striped headband. He also carries a red flag with the Straw Hat Pirates' Jolly Roger.\nDuring Heart of Gold, Luffy wore red shorts and a white and orange parka, with the right breast sporting a jolly roger with the word 'Winter' written above the skull. When going to explore Alchemi, he trades his parka for a furred jacket that matches his shorts, and wears a pith helmet with a flashlight, leaving his regular hat dangling around his neck.\nDuring Movie 13, on his way to Gran Tesoro (and throughout Film: Gold Episode 0), he wore black shorts, a red helmet with a skull at the front, and red and white nio-dasuki tied around his waist. Pinned to the back is a giant blue inflatable axe, and at the front is a large black and red loincloth showing two axes and the kanji symbol for 'Gold' written in gold. When changing to head into the casino, he wore a pure white blazer and shorts with a red handkerchief in his left breast pocket, a dark blue and orange Hawaiian shirt, and a straw cowboy hat with his regular one set around his neck. When planning the heist with Carina, he wore a red, yellow, and green tank top with a star that says 'Luck' on the front, and light blue shorts. When choosing a disguise, he jokingly went for an orange and green dress. During the heist, he wore a black leather vest and shorts, with a pair of goggles.\nDuring the Marine Rookie Arc, Luffy wears his standard post-timeskip outfit with a Marine coat over his shoulders.\nAt the start of Movie 14 (and the entire Cidre Guild Arc), Luffy wears a red and white striped shirt with his Jolly Roger on the back, pale blue shorts, white sports bandages wrapped around his torso, and a pair of geta. Strapped to his back is a large wooden instrument. In his attendance at the Pirates Festival, he changes into black shorts, an orange sash, and red button-up shirt. Topping his straw hat is a beige, patterned covering with frilled edges. Strapped to his back is a seafoam green knapsack stuffed with various objects and food, and a giant green spiked shield. When leaving the Pirates Festival after his fight with Douglas Bullet, Luffy wears an orange tank top.\nThe first outfit was designed in collaboration with UNIQLO.\nDuring Movie 15, Luffy's Festival Outfit during Uta's concert was a loose-fitting red shirt, with a white '56' on the left sleeve, and the center sporting a design of a microphone wearing his straw hat. He also wore an orange vest with yellow straps, with four fans circling around it. During his flashbacks to Foosha Village (and the Uta's Past Arc), Luffy wears red shorts and a white T-shirt with a yellow 'X' on it. His Battle Outfit consists of a bulky leather jacket with various rings, zippers, studs, and a red cross on the left sleeve which he wears around his shoulders. Paired with a loose V-neck T-shirt with a beige Jolly Roger tilted uptilted to the right, pink-ish red torn shorts, a golden buckle with a rapier strapped to it, and a large black captain's hat with a pink sash, gold trim, and a white design of a skeleton and a stripped patterning. When transforming into Gear 5 to land his final blow against Tot Musica, the Battle Outfit turns pure white as usual, though as the monster disappears his clothes morph into the form's debut appearance in the Wano Country Saga: his all-white standard outfit and a purple sash.\n\nReferences\n\nar:مونكي دي. لوفي\nca:Monkey D.

    "title": "Roronoa Zoro",
    "content": "The subject of this article is sometimes called Roronoa Zolo.\n\nRoronoa Zoro, also known as \"Pirate Hunter\" Zoro, is a main combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man and number two of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.\n\nBorn in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the \"Monster Trio\". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin Kuina.\n\nIn addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy to be included among the eleven \"Super Rookies\", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over 100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the \"Worst Generation.\"\n\nZoro gained his first bounty of 60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to 120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to 320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to 1,111,000,000.\n\nAppearance\n\nZoro is a tall, muscular man with lightly tanned skin. He always carries his three swords along with him, bundled up with a green  over his right hip, allowing him to easily draw them with his left hand. Of the three swords he has on his person, he has always been seen carrying the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two swords have varied over time due to them being destroyed and subsequently replaced with progressively better ones. Although his right hand is usually seen resting over them, he can also use this hand to pull his swords out before sitting down. He has three identical gold earrings on his left earlobe. Zoro normally keeps a black bandana tied around his left bicep and ties it around his head when he is fighting seriously against an opponent.\n\nZoro's body is covered with scars from his many battles, most notably the massive scar stretching from his left shoulder to his right hip that he acquired during his loss against the world's greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk, at Baratie. His other visible scars are the scars he inflicted upon his ankles in a desperate attempt to free himself from Mr. 3's Tokudai Candle Service Set by trying to cut his feet off at Little Garden. After the timeskip, he gained another scar over his left eye, obtained through unknown means.\n\nZoro's other remarkable feature is his cropped green hair, which Sanji often teases him about by calling him \"marimo\" (moss-ball, moss-head in the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations) due to its resemblance to one.\n\nBefore the Timeskip\nSimilar to most of his male crewmates, Zoro has the same outfit throughout most of the series. Before the timeskip, he would consistently wear black trousers tucked inside black boots, a plain white shirt with three undone buttons at the collar and his green haramaki. However, only Zoro's shirt varies from time to time in the arcs.\n\nDuring the Arlong Park Arc, he disembarked Sanji's fishing ship neglecting to put on a shirt. After beating up most of Arlong's crew, he wore an opened, navy-blue shirt decorated with light blue whirlpools that he stole from one of the fish-men. Since Zoro received his scar from Mihawk during the Baratie Arc before the Arlong Park Arc, Zoro wore bandages that were visible underneath his shirt.\n\nDuring the Loguetown Arc, Zoro acquired Sandai Kitetsu and Yubashiri to replace the two conventional katana which were broken by Mihawk in the Baratie Arc.\n\nDuring the Drum Island Arc, Zoro was bundled up for the winter island, but later stripped down after a foolish choice to swim in the frigid water on the island. He remained shirtless and barefoot in the beginning of the arc after getting lost from the Going Merry and left unable to redress himself, until he stole a parka from a man in Wapol's army, which was a hooded, forest green parka with a light green sash and white fur on the cuffs, hood, and hem, as well as a pair of boots.\n\nDuring the Arabasta Arc, he wore an orange  with a gold chain on his head, a long-sleeved white coat with black lines all over it, and the bottom of his black trousers were torn above his ankles.\n\nDuring the Skypiea Arc, he wore his usual outfit in the beginning of the arc until he took it off after fighting a sky shark to save Chopper from being eaten. Afterwards, he wore a long, deep blue tank top and goggles strapped either on his head or around his neck, which were later broken and discarded.\n\nDuring the Water 7 Arc, he wore his usual outfit until near the end, where he wore an unzipped, bright yellow jacket with a closed pocket flap on each side. He continued wearing this outfit throughout the Enies Lobby Arc.\n\nDuring the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a black shirt with the Galley-La Company emblem on it in white.\n\nAt the end of the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore an opened, gray shirt. He also replaced Yubashiri, which was rusted away by Shu in the Enies Lobby Arc, with Shusui, which was entrusted to him by the zombie of Ryuma brought to life by Brook's shadow.\n\nDuring the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, he wore an opened white shirt with red stripes.\n\nDuring his time at Kuraigana Island, shortly after being sent there by Bartholomew Kuma, he wore an opened, dark blue shirt. Since Zoro was critically injured when he arrived at the island, Perona patched him up, so bandages were all over his body.\n\nAfter the Timeskip\nDuring and after the two-year timeskip, Zoro gains a new scar running down over his left eye, which is implied to be a permanent injury, as it is always closed. His frame gets larger, showing considerably more muscle mass, and his hair has gotten shaggier, while slicked back. Zoro now wears a long, open dark-green coat closed on his waist that's held by a muted red sash, into which his three swords are tucked. His black bandanna is tied around his left forearm. His coat exposes his bare chest, revealing his green haramaki underneath the coat. He has also grown noticeably taller, as he is similar in height to Robin.\n\nDuring the Punk Hazard Arc, he wore a white furry coat for protection against the cold weather on the COOL side of Punk Hazard, which he took from Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit.\n\nDuring the Dressrosa Arc, he wore a black suit and a white dress shirt with the top button undone. He also wore black sunglasses and a fake white mustache as a disguise. His sunglasses were destroyed in his clash with Admiral Fujitora. Additionally, he discarded the moustache upon his identity being exposed. After the battle against the Donquixote Pirates, Zoro took off his suit jacket and unbuttoned his shirt, leaving his chest and scar exposed.\n\nDuring the Zou Arc, Zoro wore a dark-blue T-shirt with his green coat and haramaki over a pair of long, black trousers and boots.\n\nDuring the Wano Country Arc, Zoro wore a white yukata with black details and a green cloud pattern on its bottom. He wore a dark green jittoku haori with a mon of a black sun over a khaki gear, and zōri with a black strap. Zoro also styled his hair in the chonmage style.  After agreeing to allow Shusui to return to Ryuma's grave and remain in Wano, Zoro was given the legendary blade Enma in exchange, which was entrusted to him by Kouzuki Hiyori, the daughter of the sword's original owner, the legendary Samurai, Kouzuki Oden. During the Raid on Onigashima, Zoro donned a black version of his normal coat and a new bright red sash. He also briefly wore a Beasts Pirates uniform created by Kin'emon, before he and Luffy were discovered by the enemy pirates.\n\nDuring the Egghead Arc, after reaching the control tower, Zoro changed into a black body jumpsuit with the SSG logo on the side of the left thigh, with a dark-blue coat, blue gloves, and a belt across the upper body to hold his three swords on his back, along with a pair of orange DOM Shoes.\n\nNon-Canon\nSimiliarly to the main series, Zoro wears his standard outfit in most non-canon material. Starting with One Piece 3D: Straw Hat Chase, his standard wear is completely absent with very few exceptions.\n\nIn the Clockwork Island Adventure, after the Trump Pirates stole the Going Merry with his clothes inside, he had to wear a black kimono from a wedding store.

    "title": "Nami",
    "content": "\"Cat Burglar\" Nami is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the third member of the crew and the second to join, doing so during the Orange Town Arc. She is the adoptive sister of Nojiko after the two were orphaned and taken in by Bell-mère.\n\nShe was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates who initially joined the Straw Hats to rob them in order to buy back her village from Arlong, and served as a supporting antagonist during the Baratie Arc. However, she legitimately joined the Straw Hats after they defeated Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.\n\nShe first gained a bounty of 16,000,000 following the raid on Enies Lobby. It later increased to 66,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to 366,000,000.\n\nAppearance\n\nNami is a slim young woman of average height with ginger (orange) hair and brown eyes. Many characters seem to consider her to be an attractive woman. She has a black tattoo (blue in the anime) on her left shoulder, which represents mikan, and pinwheels (a homage to Bell-mère, Nojiko, and Genzo, respectively), where she used to have a tattoo for being a member of Arlong's crew.\n\nHer overall physique matures slowly throughout the series and then suddenly during the timeskip (though this is most likely a simple change in style of artwork). Her fashion frequently changes as does her hair style. Many of her shirts feature four-letter words, such as \"Gold\" or \"EVIL\", similar to a shirt that Bell-mère once wore that had \"MACE\" on it. On her left wrist, she wears the Log Pose, which she needs in order to be the navigator of the ship, and a gold bracelet, given to her by her sister, Nojiko. After the Arlong Park Arc, Nami frequently changes into a variety of clothes in the series for each arc, and usually pairs her tops with skirts that have two rings on the sides. Her trademark shoes are orange high-heeled gladiator sandals. Nami wears some form of high heels in every arc, and while they do make her taller, they do not seem to affect the way she walks or her speed. Though she tends to style her hair neatly, occasionally, a hair on top of her head may form into a messy cowlick.\n\nShe wears a strap around her thigh with three slots in it which she keeps each pole of her bo staff and later the Clima-Tact in.\n\nBefore the Timeskip\nBefore the Syrup Village Arc, Nami wore her trademark orange miniskirt with two white rings on each side filled in with orange or brown in their centers and shirts with short sleeves that were long enough to hide her tattoo on her left shoulder that showed that she was a member of the Arlong Pirates. She also had short hair with a particularly curled strand over the left side of her face.\n\nDuring the Romance Dawn Arc to the Syrup Village Arc, Nami's initial trademark look consisted of a white and blue striped shirt, her trademark orange mini-skirt and brown high-heeled boots.\n\nDuring the Baratie Arc, she wore a pink shirt with the letters \"W\" and a lowercase \"B\" in the center in a circle in white. The shirt has white liners and two lines along the sleeves. She also wore her yellow miniskirt, and brown high-heeled boots.\n\nDuring the Arlong Park Arc, Nami wore a green camisole with dark green flower shapes, tight black pants with two yellow rings on the sides, and light orange high-heeled sandals. Nami temporarily put on a glove to hide the fact she had stabbed her hand when pretending to murder Usopp but quit wearing it once the truth was exposed. She also wore Monkey D. Luffy's straw hat for a while before it was later returned to him. After the arc, she wore a plain white shirt with a blue miniskirt with two white rings on the sides. For the first time, she wore sleeveless clothing that exposed her Arlong Pirates tattoo, but later, in a fit of uncontrollable rage, Nami later stabbed her tattoo relentlessly in an attempt to destroy it, until Luffy stopped her by force. She eventually asked Dr. Nako to remove it, but the doctor couldn't erase it entirely, leaving a visible scar; the scar had been caused from both Nami repeatedly wounding herself in the arm and the indelible nature of the tattoo. Nami chose to cover it up by getting a new tattoo which was a cross between a tangerine and a pinwheel, in honor of both Bell-mère and Genzo. Nojiko also gave her a gold bracelet as a keepsake before she departed from her home, which Nami began to wear regularly on her left wrist ever since.\n\nDuring the Loguetown Arc, she wore a plain navy blue, short-sleeved shirt, a dark blue mini-skirt with white rings on the sides, and navy blue high-heeled sandals.\n\nDuring the Warship Island Arc to the Reverse Mountain Arc, she wore a sleeveless baby blue shirt with a light heart in the center with a crisscross design, a dark blue mini-skirt, and her regular light brown high-heeled sandals. She also received a Log Pose from Crocus and began to wear it regularly on her left wrist, the same one with her gold bracelet.\n\nDuring the Whisky Peak Arc, she wore a black shirt with the word \"MODE\" printed in the center in pink with the base in a pink mesh-like design, her regular yellow skirt and her high-heeled sandals.\n\nDuring the Little Garden Arc, she wore a simple, long-sleeved shirt with blue sleeves, her yellow skirt, and her high-heeled sandals. After escaping Mr. 3's Giant Candle Service Set, her shirt was burnt and revealed a black, lacy brassiere underneath. She also wore Sanji's jacket to cover up, before changing on the Merry.\n\nDuring the Drum Island Arc, she wore several outfits. In the beginning, Nami wore a pale blue, short-sleeved cotton sweater, her yellow skirt and high-heeled sandals. While Luffy and Sanji carried her to be treated by Dr. Kureha (she caught a fever in the previous arc), Nami wore a checkered, hooded parka with the colors white, orange and bright yellow (which Luffy later donned). She wore pale blue pajamas while recovering at Dr. Kureha's home, and a light purple blanket with light brown fur lining it when she ventured out of her room. In the end, Nami wore a long, maroon coat with fur on the hood, collar and hem, and maroon high-heeled winter boots.\n\nDuring the Arabasta Arc, she wore white overalls to protect her skin while in the desert, she retired these clothes during her fight with Zala to reveal a dancer like outfit (which Sanji had bought her earlier in the arc) after Paula damaged them. This outfit consisted of a blue and purple halter top with a pink shroud and a long white skirt with the top part blue, Nami later tore the skirt up the side to make it easier for her to run. Finally, Nami wore a long-sleeved white shirt with a brown skirt to match all of these with her normal high heels.\n\nDuring the Jaya Arc, Nami wore a blue and white striped tank top with her usual skirt and high heels.\n\nDuring the first part of the Skypiea Arc, while exploring Angel Beach and Upper Yard, she wore a bikini top that was designed in a cloud pattern colored in blue, light blue and white. She paired her top with maroon trousers and went barefoot. After returning from Upper Yard, she threw on a light yellow short-sleeved shirt over her bikini and put on her orange high-heeled sandals. Sanji notably showed dismay when Nami put on the shirt. She also wore glasses for a small period of time, and upon doing so, tied her hair back in pigtails to keep it out of her eyes, leaving it tied up for the remainder of her return trip to the Upper Yard. Nami eventually changed back out of her shirt when she had to dive into water and stayed in her bikini; Sanji was pleased to see Nami had removed it. She finally changed into a gray, zippered camisole with the word \"EVIL\" imprinted on it in big blue letters, blue cutoff jeans, and a dark gray pair of sandals.\n\nDuring the Long Ring Long Land Arc she wore a black tank top revealing her navel with the word gold on it, she also wore white jeans with two rings on the side, a bracelet, and her regular high heels.\n\nDuring the Water 7 Arc, she sported two outfits. The first one was a dark blue, short-sleeved shirt with a light blue tie that had three rows of black dots decorated diagonally at the end. She complemented her top with a white pleated skirt with golden rings on the sides and dark blue high heel gladiator sandals. After Luffy's fight with Usopp, Nami changed into a violet camisole with the number \"3\" imprinted on it in white, a white pleated mini-skirt, and her default high-heeled sandals.\n\nDuring the Enies Lobby Arc, she wore black high-heeled gladiator sandals, a brown cleavage-revealing blouse that exposes her abdomen with cream-colored liners and a pale blue, pleated mini-skirt. Initially, she also had on a blue denim jacket, but this was later caught and pierced by Kumadori's staff. This caused her to be pinned down, making Nami strip off the jacket and abandon it so she could run away.\n\nIn the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, she wore a yellow mini-dress with a hood and her default orange high-heeled sandals.\n\nDuring the Thriller Bark Arc, she sported many outfits. One of them was a pink, long-sleeved sweater with a white collar, a pleated brown mini-skirt, and brown high-heeled boots. She later wore a strapless, long wedding gown and white high-heeled pumps. She tied her hair into a short ponytail. She seemed to have abandoned the sandals for high-heeled boots as of Chapter 435, but she started using sandals again by the end of the arc.\n\nFor the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, Nami wore an orange shirt with an orange floral pattern, white short shorts, and her high-heeled sandals. Nami's clothes consisted of a pink shirt, jean shorts, and high heels for the Straw Hat's Separation Serial.\n\nAfter the Timeskip\nFrom the Return to Sabaody Arc through the Fish-Man Island Arc, Nami's appearance has undergone a few significant changes, including her hair having grown rather long, reaching down her lower back with a single long hair stand hanging on the left side with bangs still hanging over her forehead. Her breasts have also grown much larger/rounder similar to Nico Robin's, but apart from this, her appearance has not changed much, save for the fact that both her body curves and hourglass figure have become more pronounced. Oddly, Nami's face is now drawn to look younger with her eyes bigger (with the irises now showing), droopier and placed lower on her face; though this may be from the art style evolving. She also has grown slightly taller. After the timeskip, her outfit consists of a revealing green and white bikini halter top, tight low-rider jeans (that expose a bit of her hips and rear), orange high-heeled sandals and a pair of pearl-like earrings that she constantly wears. Ever since arriving to the New World, Nami sports a new belt that is black with a \"\" symbol on it where she can also keep the pieces of her Sorcery Clima-Tact on the right side and puts the belt around her waist when she is fighting seriously against an opponent.\n\nBefore leaving Fish-Man Island. she changed into a Criminal brand red halter top and tied her hair back in two ponytails behind her with blue bands, as well as removed her belt. The Minister of the Left also gave her a New World Log Pose to replace her old Log Pose, which had become unreliable due to the more unpredictable nature of magnetic fields coming from islands in the New World, which she began to wear henceforth. As the crew left the island Nami decided to unwind, undressed, and took a bath, but upon being interrupted during her bath due to the ship getting caught in a White Storm, she rushed out onto the deck only wearing a light blue hooded zippered sweatshirt over her body, as well as her new Log Pose, gold bracelet, pearl earrings. She also put on slip-on brown sandals; in the anime, she was only shown wearing them very briefly and ended up barefooted, losing her sandals when the Sunny passed through the White Storm.  \n\nAt the start of the Punk Hazard Arc, when they arrived in the New World, Nami changed into a red and yellow Criminal brand bikini top with the same pair of blue jeans, belt, and high-heeled sandals. She also tied her hair back again, and temporarily wore a pink raincoat while in stormy waters. When she reached the cold side of Punk Hazard, Sanji gave her his jacket to stay warm. She was later given a long black double-breasted coat and a set of gloves by Kin'emon using his unnamed Devil Fruit power, but when Sanji was using her body after Trafalgar Law swapped their minds with his Ope Ope no Mi, he took them off to rescue Kin'emon's displaced torso from underwater, and they changed back into rocks. He had the samurai create a new set of winter attire, a tan coat with black fur and gloves. Inside Caesar Clown's lab, she shed the coat and gloves in the warmer conditions, causing them to revert back to rocks.\n\nAfter returning to the Thousand Sunny, she changed into real and more personalized stylish winter clothing and also replaced the clothes which were not suited for the cold, putting on a high-collared black coat with three sets of gold buttons held together by straps, brown gloves, a set of black leggings instead of jeans, and in place of her sandals, a set of calf-high dark brown boots with white fur insulating the boots at the calves. Once the crew had sailed out of Punk Hazard into more pleasant conditions, she wore a pink sleeveless shirt with the word \"HEAT\" on it in red letters with a picture of candy below it, teal and white striped shorts, and her high-heeled sandals.\n\nDuring the Dressrosa Arc, Nami's first outfit consists of a tank top and short shorts. Later, while playing a shogun scene on the Sunny, she wears a bikini top, a necklace with a star pendant, short shorts, and very high heels. After the crew had split up, she changed into a frilled halterneck and a pleated frilled skirt with round studs around the waistline and a small decorative bow in front. She wore her hair back in a ponytail with a scrunchie and kept her pearl earrings and high-heeled sandals.\n\nWhile on Zou, Nami wore a sleeveless fancy purple dress covered in fancy pearls, which is a national treasure of Zou. She still wears her high-heeled sandals, and her hair is loose. When leaving Zou she wore a skirt and shirt with the number \"73\" on it and later a hooded fur coat when the crew was traveling in cold weather.\n\nIn the Whole Cake Island Arc, Nami bought a corset skirt and blouse, making her look like a \"pretzel girl\", which Carrot and Brook liked. Before landing on Whole Cake Island, Nami briefly wore a suit of armor with spears on the back (due to fighting ants all night) but changed out of it instantly. Later on, after her original outfit gets destroyed in a fire, she steals new clothes from an unconscious man lying nearby; blue overalls with very large, puffy pant legs along with a pink sash wrapped around her waist. When meeting with the Fire Tank Pirates, she wore a short, backless turtleneck red dress. After escaping Whole Cake Island, she wore a white long sleeve mini dress and donned another belt, similar to the one when arriving the New World, but brown; with her new upgraded Clima-Tact on the side of her waist.\n\nIn the Wano Country Arc, Nami first wore a dark-colored (light purple in the anime) dress with yellow outlines. She was later given a blue and orange revealing kunoichi outfit by Kin'emon. Her third outfit was a baby blue kimono with a dark-colored (pink in the anime) floral pattern, and wore her hair in a loose bun. Her fourth outfit consists of a red kunoichi outfit with a dark-colored (also pink in the anime) floral pattern, completely reminiscent to her first one, with the addition of an armor plate for her midsection, tied with a yellow ribbon, and flower decor on her hair, with her Clima-Tact hidden safely on her, even after the weapon merges with the Homie; Zeus. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, she wore a Beasts Pirates attire. During her respite following the Raid on Onigashima, she wears a greenish-blue kimono with a pinkish-white floral pattern, and later a pink one with a purple and white floral pattern. When leaving Wano, she wears reddish-orange overalls that end at her upper thighs, a bright yellow sweater, and her trademark sandals.\n\nDuring the Egghead Arc, Nami is shown wearing a white leotard bodysuit with a hood and 'SSG' written in black on her left breast, a pale pink-and-blue earpiece, and a pair of pink DOM Shoes.\n\nBody Measurements\nThe author has also answered to a fan's question asking about Nami's  are as follows:\nIn SBS Volume 6, according to Sanji, her measurements were B86-W57-H86 (34\"-22\"-34\"), and in SBS Volume 10, according to Eiichiro Oda, her height was 169 cm (5'6\").\nUpdated measurements were provided in SBS Volume 37, in which Oda then responded to a fan question by saying that her height was 169 cm (5'6\"), and according to Sanji, her three measurements were B95-W55-H85 (37.4\"-21.65\"-33.46\"), making her breasts an I-cup in Japan.

    "content": "\"God\" Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the fourth member of the crew and the third to join, doing so at the end of the Syrup Village Arc. Although he left the crew during the Water 7 Arc, he rejoined at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.\n\nUsopp is the son of Yasopp and the late Banchina. He was born and raised in Syrup Village, serving as \"captain\" of the Usopp Pirates and being Kaya's close friend. After working with the Straw Hats to defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he was invited to join the crew. Despite his usual cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave warrior of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of living up to this dream.\n\nHe first gained a bounty of 30,000,000 under his Sogeking Persona after the incident at Enies Lobby. After the Dressrosa Arc, Usopp gained a bounty of 200,000,000 under his own name. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to 500,000,000.\n\nAppearance\n\nBefore the Timeskip\nUsopp is a slim tan-skinned teenager with medium-length black curly hair, prominent lips and a long nose, which is apparently an allusion to  (a wooden boy from a story of the same name who possessed a nose that would stretch after he lied). Usopp inherited his famous nose from his mother, while the rest of his face closely resembles his father's. During the Straw Hat separation, after landing in the Boin Archipelago, Usopp grew obese from overeating.\n\nLike the rest of the males of the crew, he wore one outfit for the majority of the series before wearing different clothing by the end of the Paradise. Usopp usually wore an olive green plaid bandanna, a blue and white striped armband on his left arm, along with special sniper goggles (he also has a pair of clear rectangular goggles that he sometimes wears in situations where he does not have his sniper goggles, like when he first met the Straw Hat Pirates or when his sniper goggles were stolen by Mr. 2), brown overalls with a white sash and no shirt underneath. He also carries with him a yellow satchel, which he stores all his tools and gadgets in.\n\nDuring the Drum Island Arc, he wore a brown jumper with white fur collar and cuffs, faded yellow gloves and grey pants with a black \"c\" pattern.\n\nDuring the walk through the desert in the Arabasta Arc, he wore a brown keffiyeh under his goggles and a dull red (blue in Volume 19 cover, and dull green in the anime) and black striped desert cloak.\n\nDuring the Skypiea Arc, he wore a murky green shirt underneath brown overalls and some bandages on his torso and arms after getting attacked by Enel.\n\nDuring the final game of the Davy Back Fight, he wore a yellow zip-up coach jacket, a red towel around his shoulders, and silver sunglasses with purple lenses. Usopp was also trusted with Luffy's straw hat which he wore on his head.\n\nDuring the Water 7 Arc, he wore bandages under his overalls again after being attacked by the Franky Family.\n\nWhile onboard the Puffing Tom he put on a gold-colored sun-like mask he found in a compartment over his goggles and wore a red cape, calling this superhero persona \"Sogeking\". Usopp wore this costume for the rest of the Enies Lobby Arc. \n\nDuring the Thriller Bark Arc, Usopp wore a purple cape and a wide brim purple hat with a necklace of garlic to ward off evil creatures.\n\nDuring the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, Usopp wore an unbuttoned turquoise shirt instead of his overalls and some green shorts with a yellow flower pattern on one leg.\n\nAfter the Timeskip\nAfter the two-year timeskip, Usopp has become much more muscular than before and has grown his hair out. He has become \"manlier\" and is slightly taller than before.\n\nUsopp now has a new pair of goggles around his neck (his sniper goggles weren't shown) and has some headphones or ear protectors on. He also now has a little goatee along with a new white wide brim sun cap he wears on his head. He also has a new pair of rolled-up yellow pants with red suspenders and a pair of boots.\n\nHis trademark yellow satchel has been replaced with a red one, but he still has his blue and white striped wristband on his left arm.\n\nDuring the Punk Hazard Arc, he wore a purple coat with light blue lining on the sides, which he took from one of Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit.\n\nDuring the Dressrosa Arc, he wore an orange open jacket with a ring of circles on the arms and a red cap which has a pointy stub on the end, which he used to make the Dwarves believe he was a descendant of Noland.\n\nDuring the Zou Arc, he wore a light green short-sleeved collared shirt buttoned up halfway with a short, black line on the middle of each sleeve and a dark green cap with his signature goggles resting on top of it.\n\nIn the Wano Country Arc, Usopp wears a light blue yukata underneath a pair of black and white striped , as well as a green bandanna adorned with a frog and fake old man beard. During the Raid on Onigashima, Usopp wears his usual yellow pants, blue and white striped wristband, satchel, and headphones, however instead of suspenders, Usopp decides to wear a dark multi-colored armor plate with brown gloves and red protective head gear. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, he wore a Beasts Pirates disguise, adding his googles as a part of the disguise.\n\nDuring the Egghead Arc, Usopp wears a lime green jumpsuit, a forest green jacket with matching gloves, a purple bandana with a gear pattern, and a gold earpiece with an antenna on it. He also wears a pair of sunglasses with yellow-orange lenses, an orange satchel with a beige strap, and a pair of gold DOM Shoes.  \n\nNon-Canon\nIn the Movie 2, he initially appears with a red and white striped swimwear. After the Trump Pirates stole the Going Merry with his clothes inside, he had to wear a brown kimono and a black hat from a wedding store. Then he changes his clothes for an orange jacket and dark green pants, returning to wear his usual bandanna.\n\nIn the Movie 3, he wears overalls with camouflage print, his white sash at the waist. He also wears his orange glasses during the plot. Also momentarily, he wears an extravagant lion costume designed by himself.\n\nDuring the G-8 Arc, he infiltrates as a Marine soldier, wearing a Marine uniform and cap.\n\nReferences\n\nca:Usopp\nde:Usopp\nes:Usopp\nfr:Usopp\nit:Usop\nid:Usopp\nnl:Usopp\npl:Usopp\npt:Usopp\nro:Usopp\nru:Усопп\nth:อุซป\ntr:Usopp\nvi:Usopp\nzh:騙人布\nCategory:Humans\nCategory:Male Characters\nCategory:Snipers\nCategory:Craftsmen\nCategory:Treasure Pirates Slaves\nCategory:Straw Hat Pirates\nCategory:Usopp Pirates\nCategory:Observation Haki Users\nCategory:Fighters Who Use Technology\nCategory:Explosive Users\nCategory:Dial Weapon Users\nCategory:Shuriken Users\nCategory:Paradise Residents"

    "title": "Sanji",
    "content": "\"Black Leg\" Sanji, born as Vinsmoke Sanji, is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.\n\nBorn as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus, making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew. \n\nHis dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where the East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, who are referred to as the \"Monster Trio\".\n\nHe first gained a bounty of 77,000,000 for his role in the raid on Enies Lobby. It increased to 177,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only Alive due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped from Big Mom's territory, his bounty condition was reverted back to Dead or Alive (with the Vinsmoke name despite his renouncing it), and its value increased to 330,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to 1,032,000,000.\n\nAppearance\n\nSanji is a tall, slim, muscular man with long legs and jaw-length blond hair which he keeps brushed over one side of his face. Before the timeskip, this was the left side. After the two-year timeskip, he switched his hairstyle so that it covers the right side. It also appears that Sanji's hair is less straight and scruffier after the timeskip.\n\nSanji's most distinctive physical trait is the spirals on his eyebrows: His right eyebrow forms a spiral at the outer end, while his left eyebrow forms a spiral at the inner end. His eyebrows curl in the opposite direction from his siblings, whose eyebrows curl in a counterclockwise direction (i.e., to the left side); Sanji's eyebrows instead curl in a clockwise direction (i.e., to the right side). During his battle with Queen, when his dormant genetic modifications awakened, Sanji's eyebrows switched to curling in the same direction as his siblings' (i.e., to the left side). After being unconscious for a brief period, when he awoke, his eyebrows had returned to their original shape. When fighting S-Shark, his eyebrows changed direction again, although they reverted back following the battle. After deflecting Kizaru's laser with a kick, his eyebrows have once again changed directions.\n\nWhile Sanji's eyes usually seem black, he was depicted with grey-blue eyes in the anime at the beginning of Thriller Bark Arc. During the Punk Hazard Arc, when Trafalgar Law switched Sanji into Nami's body, her usual brown eyes became grey blue in color.\n\nSanji almost always wears a black, double-breasted suit with golden buttons and a tie together with a long-sleeved buttoned shirt of varying colors, usually orange, blue, turquoise, or black, with or without pinstripes. His outfit changes on a more frequent basis than most of the crew.\n\nAs a child, Sanji wore a yellow shirt with the number \"3\" on it, white pants, brown boots, and a light-yellow bandana around his neck. His hair was styled in the opposite manner as it is in the present.\n\nBefore the Timeskip\nDuring the Baratie Arc, he wore a blue shirt with black pinstripes.\n\nDuring the Drum Island Arc, he wore a brown coat with furry outlining.\n\nDuring the Arabasta Arc, he wore blue jacket-like attire suited for the desert in addition to orange sunglasses.\n\nDuring the Skypiea Arc, he wore a pink dotted shirt with black knee-length pants. Later on he changed into a dark blue shirt with light blue lines running down from the shoulders.\n\nDuring the Long Ring Long Land Arc, he wore a lavender shirt and a blue tie with a cross pattern.\n\nDuring the Water 7 Arc, he did not wear a suit jacket, but a black vest over an orange shirt with black pinstripes.\n\nDuring the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a darker lavender shirt with a red tie.\n\nDuring the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore a dark blue shirt with a light blue tie, as well as his usual black suit jacket and trousers.\n\nDuring the Sabaody Archipelago Arc he wore a green shirt and a white tie with purple horizontal stripes.\n\nDuring the Straw Hats' separation, Sanji was coerced into dressing as a typical okama, wearing a pink dress with short puffy sleeves. He also wore a long blond curly wig, nail polish, a pair of woman's undergarments, and heavy, trashy makeup. He was also seen with a pair of high heels. He later reverts to his usual outfit and appearance sometime after that.\n\nHe almost always wears black dress shoes, mostly for his Black Leg Style. These shoes are extremely durable and were designed to increase the power of his attacks, though he can attack sufficiently without them as shown in his fight against Kuroobi. Sanji is also a chain-smoker and is rarely seen without a cigarette.\n\nAfter the Timeskip\nAfter the two-year timeskip, Sanji now covers his right eye, shows his left eye, and has grown his hair just slightly longer. He also sports a dark anchor style facial hair, and stubble on his upper lip. Sanji's neck has gotten thicker as well, similar to Luffy and Zoro. He has grown taller, and therefore remains nearly the exact same height as Zoro. He wears a black double-breasted suit (which is sometimes depicted as dark blue) with golden buttons and a yellow dress shirt together with a brown tie. \n\nIn Punk Hazard, he wears a full black double-breasted suit with golden buttons and a grey dress shirt together with a very light grey tie.\n\nWhile on Punk Hazard, Kin'emon used his Fuku Fuku no Mi ability to give Sanji a double-breasted coat for the cold, as he was trapped in Nami's body because of Trafalgar Law.\n\nDuring the Dressrosa Arc, Sanji first wore a white dress shirt which he wore untucked, with a black tie, black trousers and a black, pinstriped waistcoat. Upon going incognito into Acacia, he wore a black double-breasted suit, with a white shirt with the top button undone. In the anime he wears a blue tie as well. He also wore black glasses and a fake white beard and mustache, and put a red rose in his breast pocket. After being injured by Doflamingo, Sanji wore bandages around his chest and wore his shirt and suit jacket unbuttoned and over his shoulders.\n\nAfter arriving on Zou, Sanji sported a pair of brown sunglasses (with his hair still covering one of the glasses) an orange leather jacket, a white dress shirt with a purple polka dot pattern, yellow trousers, brown shoes and a small backpack. He also slightly trimmed his beard. Later, he wore a black fur-trimmed coat over a dress shirt, and a beaded necklace.\n\nDuring the Whole Cake Island Arc, Sanji wore a white, frilled dress shirt as well as his usual black dress pants and shoes; he keeps the collar of the shirt upturned and the first few buttons undone. Later, his wrists are each fitted with a gold exploding wristlet (later revealed to be fakes), and his face is discretely covered by a transparent hi-tech mask given to him by his sister, to remove the facial swelling he received during a violent confrontation with his brothers. Once he departed for Whole Cake Chateau with his family, he was also clad in a red, single-shoulder royal cape held together with a golden chain and clasp. During the Tea Party, he wore a white tuxedo, comprising a dress shirt and ascot under a white vest, white trousers and shoes, and an open formal coat with a raised collar. After finishing the second wedding cake, Sanji disguised himself as one of the WCI 31 chefs by wearing a chef hat and a rag.\n\nDuring the Levely Arc, Sanji wore a dark gray dress shirt with an orange tie, black pants, and bandages wrapped around his right arm.\n\nIn the Wano Country Arc, Sanji was given a yellow and white stripped yukata by Kin'emon with a top knot the same as Luffy and Zoro. Later, he dons the raid suit that was given to him by his family, which gives Sanji a black Germa outfit and black and red cape with the number 3 on it, a white belt with the Germa 66 logo on the front, long white gloves with orange and black cuffs, jet-propelled boots. Uniquely, it also gives him a mask to wear over his nose and mouth, as well as a pair of sunglasses and a set of earphones on the top of his head. It also slicks the front of his hair into two parts, one pointing up and one pointing down. During the Raid on Onigashima, Sanji wore a burgundy suit, a black shirt, a red tie which was later changed to white, and black gloves before briefly changing into a Beasts Pirates attire with the help of Kin'emon's Devil Fruit power.\n\nDuring the Egghead Arc, Sanji wears a hooded orange Hawaiian shirt with a blue and yellow floral pattern, a pair of black shorts with the name Vegapunk written on the side, an earpiece, and a pair of orange DOM Shoes.\n\nNon-Canon\nIn Clockwork Island Adventure, he initially appears he appears with a blue two-tone swimsuit. After the Trump Pirates stole the Going Merry with his clothes inside, he had to wear a white tuxedo with a red rose on the flap from a wedding store. Then he changes his clothes for a green jacket, with a gray shirt underneath, and black pants.\n\nIn Chopper's Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals, he wears a dark brown jacket, with the chest area exposed, a white collar, and black pants. He also wears his orange glasses during the plot. Also momentarily, he wears an extravagant panda costume designed by Usopp.\n\nDuring the G-8 Arc, he infiltrates as a Marine cook, wearing a white cook uniform, a blue scarf on his neck, and a white chef hat.\n\nReferences\n\nar:سانجي\nca:Sanji\nde:Vinsmoke Sanji\nel:Sanji\nes:Sanji\neu:Sanji\nfr:Sanji\nhe:סנג'י\nid:Sanji\nit:Vinsmoke Sanji\nja:ヴィンスモーク・サンジ\nka:სანჯი\nmy:ဆန်ဂျိ\nnl:Vinsmoke Sanji\npl:Vinsmoke Sanji\npt:Vinsmoke Sanji\nro:Sanji\nru:Винсмок Санджи\ntr:Sanji\nuk:Вінсмок Санджи\nvi:Sanji\nzh:賓什莫克·香吉士\nCategory:Modified Humans\nCategory:Cooks\nCategory:Former Princes\nCategory:Former Prisoners\nCategory:Straw Hat Pirates\nCategory:Vinsmoke Family\nCategory:Rokushiki Users\nCategory:Observation Haki Users\nCategory:Armament Haki Users\nCategory:Fighters Who Use Technology\nCategory:Momoiro Island Residents\nCategory:Baratie Characters"
